## Trial Extension & Recovery

### Trial Expiring Sequence
| Timing | Message |
|--------|---------|
| 3 days before | "Your trial ends in 3 days - complete setup" |
| 1 day before | "Last day! Don't lose your work" |
| Expiration day | "Your trial has ended - upgrade to continue" |
| Day after | "Miss us? Here's 7 more days free" |

### Grace Period Strategy
- Extend trial if user showed engagement
- Offer discount for immediate conversion
- Preserve data but limit access
- Re-engagement email sequence

### Win-Back Offers

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Techniques
1. **Show highest tier first** - Anchors expectations
2. **Cross out original price** - Shows savings
3. **Annual savings displayed** - "Save $120/year"
4. **Compare to alternatives** - "Less than a coffee/day"

### Decoy Effect
```
Basic     Pro (Popular)     Enterprise
$9/mo     $29/mo            $99/mo
5 seats   25 seats          Unlimited
1 GB      25 GB             100 GB
```
Middle tier looks best compared to extremes

### Loss Aversion
```
"Your 14-day trial has ended"

You'll lose:
• 12 projects created
