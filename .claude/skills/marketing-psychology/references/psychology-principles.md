## Cialdini's Principles of Persuasion

### 1. Reciprocity

- Surprise upgrades or bonuses
- Free tools and calculators
- Valuable newsletter content

### 2. Commitment & Consistency
**Principle:** People want to act consistently with prior commitments

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|

| Public commitments | Social sharing |
| Foot-in-the-door | Free trial before paid |
| Progressive disclosure | Multi-step forms |

**Application:**
- Start with small asks, build up
- Remind users of past actions
- "You've already completed 70%"
- Highlight user's goals/preferences

### 3. Social Proof

| Expert | High | "Recommended by [Authority]" |

| Peers | Highest | "Companies like yours use..." |

**Application:**

| Association | Align with liked brands/causes |

**Application:**

| Information | "Hidden" or "secret" content |

**Application:**

## BJ Fogg Behavior Model

### B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt)

```
High Motivation    ↑
                   │  ┌─────────────────┐
                   │  │   ACTION ZONE   │
                   │  │   (Prompts work │
                   │  │    here)        │
                   │  └─────────────────┘
                   │         ↗
                   │       ↗  Action Line
                   │     ↗
Low Motivation     │   ↗
                   └───────────────────────→
                   Hard                Easy
                        Ability
```

## Pricing Psychology

### Price Presentation
| Tactic | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Charm pricing | $29.99 vs $30 | Perceived 15-20% lower |
| Anchor high | ~~$199~~ $99 | Shows value |
| Bundle | 3 for $25 vs $10 each | Perceived savings |
| Per unit | $1/day vs $365/year | Feels cheaper |
| Remove currency | 29 vs $29 | Less painful |

### Price Anchoring
```
ENTERPRISE     PRO ← Target    BASIC
$299/mo        $99/mo          $29/mo
```
Enterprise anchors high, making Pro seem reasonable.

### Decoy Pricing
```
Small: $3.00 (12 oz)
Medium: $6.50 (16 oz) ← Decoy
Large: $7.00 (24 oz) ← Target
```
Medium makes Large look like the best deal.

## Choice Architecture

### Reducing Choice Overload
| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Limit options | 3-4 choices maximum |
| Set defaults | Pre-select recommended |
| Categorize | Group similar options |
| Progressive disclosure | Show more as needed |
| Guided choice | "Best for you" quiz |

### Default Effect
| Context | Best Default |
|---------|--------------|
| Pricing toggle | Annual (higher LTV) |
| Tier selection | Middle tier (most popular) |
| Newsletter | Opt-in (quality > quantity) |
| Features | Essential on, advanced off |

### Paradox of Choice
- More options → More anxiety
- More options → Less satisfaction
- More options → Lower conversion
- **Solution:** Curate, recommend, simplify

## Trust Building

### Trust Elements by Stage
| Stage | Trust Signals |
|-------|---------------|
| First visit | Logos, design quality, HTTPS |
| Considering | Testimonials, case studies, reviews |
| Ready to buy | Guarantees, security badges, support |
| Post-purchase | Onboarding, communication, support |

### Trust Hierarchy
```
1. Third-party endorsement (highest)
2. Customer testimonials
3. Expert recommendations
4. Social proof (numbers)
5. Self-claims (lowest)
```

### Risk Reversal
| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Money-back guarantee | "30-day refund, no questions" |
| Free trial | "Try before you buy" |
| Free returns | "Easy returns, free shipping" |
| Success guarantee | "Or we'll work free until you succeed" |

## Persuasive Copy Patterns

### Problem-Agitate-Solve
```
Problem: "Spending hours on reports?"
Agitate: "Every hour is $100 lost..."
Solve: "Automate in 5 minutes."
```

### Future Pacing
```
"Imagine opening your dashboard to see..."
"Picture yourself with..."
"What would you do with 10 extra hours?"
```

### Social Proof Integration
```
"Join 10,000+ marketers who..."
"[Company] increased revenue 40% using..."
"Rated 4.9/5 by 500+ customers"
```

### Urgency & Scarcity
```
Genuine urgency: "Price increases Jan 1"
Manufactured urgency: "Today only" (use carefully)
Scarcity: "Only 3 spots left for this cohort"
```
